# CS193X spreadsheets tool

This is a tool published for CS193x: Web Programming Fundamentals at Stanford University.

**CS193X Students:**
- See HW5 writeup for description of how to use this.

**Non-CS193X students:**
- If you're a random person on the internet who somehow found this tool: This tool as-is won't really be useful for you. I have the non-CS193X [version here](https://github.com/vrk/sheets-service), though it's not published on npm.
